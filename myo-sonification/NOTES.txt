The red on/off buttons on the left (from the top):
1- Start OSC
2- Start the wavetable buffers
3- Start the wavetables

...on the right:
1- Start the EMG signal visualization


You should first type the OSC port and address, then start the engine.

Press "O" on the keyboard to randomly change the pitch.

You can adjust the volume of the wavetables separately.

You can adjust the amount of the reverb with the stereo fader in the bottom.

You can adjust the filter parameters.

Now the envelopes are also connected to random objects, 
but you can turn off that to select the envelope shapes manually, 
through the tiny buttons that are on the top-right of the envelope windows. 

I have added some feature extractors to be used as control signals,
but they are not mapped to any parameter now. We can discuss about that.
